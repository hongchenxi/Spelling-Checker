The UITextChecker object can be used to spelling-check a string. In this tutorial a few words will be displayed inside a Table View. When the words are selected, they will be checked for spelling, the background color will change to green if the spelling is correct, otherwise the background color will change to red. This tutorial is made in Xcode 7.2 for iOS 9.
